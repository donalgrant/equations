The WFF-n-Proof Equations Game

This application implements the WFF-n-Proof game of Equations.  
Currently, this is an interactive text-based game:  computer vs. a human player.

The structure of the code is a perl script at the top-level (currently rpn_new.pl),
a set of perl modules in the lib/ folder, and a set of module tests in the t/ folder.

There is not yet an automated install process, so that the argument of the "use lib ..."
statement must be edited in each script and module.
